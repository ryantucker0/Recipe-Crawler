# **Recipe-Crawler**
Food ingredient recipe crawler. You have x in the fridge, you can make y.

## Open Notes:

Will need to build relational database with recipes. Should eventually pull from somewhere legit but for now I'll just store some basic things I come up with to test the programming. Would eventually want to build front-end for input from user too.

I'm thinking I may want to use the [MEAN stack] (https://www.codingdojo.com/what-is-the-mean-stack)

Maybe I'll follow this? https://medium.com/netscape/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-1-18691663ea96

It looks like this is going to be really complicated... going to bed for now.
