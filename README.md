# **Recipe-Crawler**
Food ingredient recipe crawler. You have x in the fridge, you can make y.

This README will act as a journal through my progress for now. If I actually finish this, I'll turn this into an actual README.

## Open Notes:

Will need to build relational database with recipes. Should eventually pull from somewhere legit but for now I'll just store some basic things I come up with to test the programming. Would eventually want to build front-end for input from user too.

I'm thinking I may want to use the [MEAN stack] (https://www.codingdojo.com/what-is-the-mean-stack)

Maybe I'll follow this? https://medium.com/netscape/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-1-18691663ea96

It looks like this is going to be really complicated... going to bed for now.

It's been a busy few months! I actually forgot all about this idea. In the past 4 months I switched jobs (still same company), moved to FL, and got married/went on a honeymoon. I want to get back to learning some programming so I thought it would be good to start this up again.

First, I'd like to learn the MEAN stack. At first, I'll start with this tutorial:https://medium.com/netscape/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-1-18691663ea96 to learn the ropes. Will put it in the directory "learnMEAN."

Today, I set up the environment. I left off at *"Database"* in the article.
